HIPImageCropper
===============

A reusable image cropping and scaling interface for iOS, similar to Instagram's beautiful implementation. It's very barebones on purpose, but it takes care of all basics:

* Properly align and place any image (portrait or landscape)
* Set the correct minimum and maximum zoom properties
* Support for all orientations and autoresizing
* Support for customized cropping area dimensions
* Quartz-drawn iOS camera capture style overlay
* Automatically snaps photo to the edges

Here is a screenshot of the demo app that uses a basic "Capture" button: <http://cl.ly/image/203u0Q3J0J2t>.
